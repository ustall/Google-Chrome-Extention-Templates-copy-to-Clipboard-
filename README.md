# Google Chrome Extention Templates copy to Clipboard
## Overview
I often had to copy various prepared text presets while working by Add Operation Manager in the Google Chrome browser. To simplify this task and speed up the work, I wrote this browser extension that copies the preset from the txt file to the clipboard with convenient interface made by html and manifest version 3.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an easy-to-use interface for copy-pasting text templates.

- **Customizable text templates** Easyily change your text templates in ![templates.txt](/GHExtention/templates.txt)

- **Easy to setup:** Just load unpacked extention to Chromium based browswer.
